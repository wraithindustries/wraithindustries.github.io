    <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Dossiers’s website and our apps for iPhone, iPad, and any other devices and platforms.</p><br />

    <p>Wraith Industries (“us”, “we”, “our”) takes personal privacy seriously. We limit the collection of personal information to cases where we truly need it or are required for the operation of our products. Personal information is never shared except to comply with the law, develop and improve our products, or protect our rights.</p><br />

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Analytics</h3><br />

    <p>This section of our Privacy Policy explains how we use analytics tools and the anonymous, non-identifiable data we collect from your use of our application (“the App”) to improve our product and services, while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and data protection.</p><br />

    <h4 class="text-xl">Anonymous, Non-Identifiable Data Collection</h4><br />

    <p>When you use the App, we collect general usage data that cannot be used to personally identify you. This data includes information about how you interact with the App, the features you use, the duration of your sessions, and any feedback you provide. Importantly, we do not collect your IP address, ensuring that your usage data remains entirely anonymous.</p><br />

    <h4 class="text-xl">No Collection of User-Generated Content</h4><br />

    <p>We value your privacy and take the utmost care to protect your personal information. To that end, we do not collect, store, or analyze any user-generated content created within the App. Our analytics are focused solely on anonymous, non-identifiable data related to the general use and performance of the App, without accessing or processing any personal or sensitive information you may include within the content you create.</p><br />

    <p>By refraining from collecting user-generated content, we ensure that your personal information remains private, secure, and under your control at all times.</p><br />

    <p>To analyze the anonymous, non-identifiable data we collect, we use reputable and secure third-party analytics tools. These tools help us understand user behavior and preferences, which enables us to enhance the App’s features, user interface, and overall performance. The third-party analytics providers we work with are bound by strict data protection agreements and are prohibited from using your data for any purpose other than assisting us with our analytics.</p><br />

    <p>We use Apple as a source for analytics. Apple’s Privacy Policy can be <a class="text-accent-500" href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/">found here</a>.</p><br />

    <h4 class="text-xl">Purpose of Analytics and Usage Data</h4><br />

    <p>We use the anonymous, non-identifiable data we collect for the following purposes:</p><br />

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Improvement:</strong> By analyzing usage patterns, we can identify areas where the App can be enhanced or where new features may be needed, ultimately improving the overall user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> By studying how users interact with the App, we can optimize the App’s performance, ensuring faster load times, smoother navigation, and a more enjoyable user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>User Support:</strong> Understanding common user issues and concerns allows us to improve our support resources and provide more effective assistance when users encounter difficulties.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Development:</strong> Gaining insights into the features that are most valued by users helps us prioritize future development and deliver an App that better meets your needs and expectations.</li>
    </ul><br />

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Email</h3><br />

    <p>If you email us for support or other feedback, the emails and email addresses will be retained. The email addresses will only be used to reply to the concerns or suggestions raised and will never be used for any marketing purpose.</p><br />

    <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.</p><br />

    <p>We do not share your personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Dossier’s functionality.</p><br />

    <p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p><br />

    <p>You may access or change your information or delete your account at any time by going into Settings > iCloud on your iOS device.</p><br />

    <h3 class="text-2xl">iCloud</h3><br />

    <p>Dossier stores your data in Apple’s iCloud service, such as lists and list items to enable sync features between all devices signed into your Apple ID.</p><br />

    <h3 class="text-2xl">California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3><br />

    <p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p><br />
